  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This is a command-line application that helps the user create a simple, custom logo in an .svg file. Freelance web developers can use this application to create logos and branding without the need of a graphic designer. The application recieves user input for text (up to three characters), text color, shape (square, circle, triangle), and shape color. Once all criteria is completed, the application then generates a logo.svg file with the user's criteria. This application runs nodejs and inquirer to record the user input and generate the file. With the jest package, unit testing was performed to ensure the shapes were properly rendered. A video link will be included showing both running the application and unit testing.  

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  Node required, npm inquirer required, npm jest required. The user can clone this code and run the node command in the terrminal to generate the SVG File. Prior to running the node command, the user must ensure to install the required node packages. 

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  The user will run the node command to prompt questions pertaining to each section of the SVG file. Once all sections are completed, a logo.svg file will be generated with the input created by the user through the terminal. This SVG will render the proper text, shape, and color from the user input. The SVG file will be a total pixel size of 300x200.
